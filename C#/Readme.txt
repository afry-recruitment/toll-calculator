- My Solution is an API with a GET method to calculate toll fee with a test project for the GetTollFee method.
- Lookup data (toll free vehicle types, fee intervals/values, toll free dates, regulations) is stored in JSON files.
- In production data should be fetched from an external API or a DB
- If you want to add additional examples for testing the API you need to add it to the corresponding JSON file.
	e.g. new toll free date should be added to TollFreeDates.json, etc.
