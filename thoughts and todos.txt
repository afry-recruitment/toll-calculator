Dynamically generate test data, vehicles and dates
Algorithm for fees, sort dates into subsets and pick highest fee.'

For timelimit, hour I interpret it as first time + 60 minutes. In case of overlapping, just cut after 60 and start anew.

Since tollfees probably gonna change, it´s a good thing to give it it´s own class
And also, TollCalculator should use a class Toll for it's calculations, Toll may be used for other tasks too.

Making toll-fees into a map where new time-windows and fees can be easily changed without affecting functionality of the code seems like a good thing to do.

Converting between different kinds of date/time datastructures feels a little sketchy

Finilizing:
Documentation comments
Nullchecking/errorhandling
Values/ghostnumbers

Suggestions:
-Make test data and write tests
-Implement all sorts of vehicles
