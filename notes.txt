Key Takeaways:
	* Modular application for easier developing and more sustainable code -> helps further developing
	* Possibility to automatically fetch holidays for any country - independently on year
	* Applied design patterns for smoother and better development
	* Unit-tests for the vital components of the application has been added


Future improvements: 
	* Better if DateHandler is possible to parse own-defined holiday dates, e.g. json with dates etc.
	* Good if TollCalculator uses API for updating toll fees, e.g. an REST-API or Firebase for realtime updates on fees.

If wanted to run the dynamical DateHandler, run application with Java 8
