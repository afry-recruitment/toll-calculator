## Implementation

### 1 - Entity relationship diagram
   [ER-diagram](ER-diagram.png)

### 2 - Multitenancy
    The application is built as per the Multitenancy architecture. With the same instance, we will be able to configure N number of cities.

### 3 - Data are configurable
    Almost all the properties moved to the database. So any changes in the city can be modified easily.

### 4 - No tax for days before the public holiday and holiday month
    Additionally added before holiday and holiday month also no tax day or month which is again configurable.

### 5 - Change in tax charge pattern
    The tax charge for 18:30â€“05:59 is configued as 18:30 to 11:59 and 00:00 to 05:59 for better calculation.

### 6 - Extended support for all years (2013)
    The tax calculator will not serve only for 2013, but it also serves any data belonging to any year.
